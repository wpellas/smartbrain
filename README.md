# What is this?

This is a project for the 'The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery' course from Zero to Mastery.

### How is it used?

You can register an account which passes the info through an express.js (node) server to an SQL database and then log in to your account. When logged in, you can paste an image URL that contains a humans face into the URL and have the app detect the face in the image. As of now, this only works with one face. If an image with multiple faces is inserted, only one is found.
